DermAid: Intelligent Skin Health Platform 🩺✨
All models and frontend deployed and live on: https://derm-aid.vercel.app/

🚀 The Concept

DermAid is the first Dual-Agent AI System designed to bridge the critical gap between daily cosmetic skincare and medical pre-diagnosis.

Most apps are either "Beauty Filters" (ignoring health) or "Symptom Checkers" (ignoring daily care). DermAid combines both into a single Agentic Ecosystem that doesn't just analyze your skin—it learns, adapts, and protects you over time.

🧠 How It Works (The Dual-Agent System)

The platform runs two specialized AI Agents autonomously on your device:

🧖‍♀️ The Cosmetic Agent (Face): Your daily aesthetician. It tracks acne, pigmentation, and aging signs, adapting your routine weekly based on your progress and skin tolerance.

🩺 The Medical Agent (Body): Your health safety net. It continuously monitors for suspicious lesions (like Eczema, Psoriasis, or Melanoma risks) and provides intelligent triage—telling you when to self-treat and when to see a doctor immediately.

✨ Key Features

Agentic Adaptation: Unlike static apps, DermAid's AI autonomously modifies your routine based on external factors (Weather/UV Index) and internal feedback (Skin sensitivity).

True Inclusivity: Built with specialized logic for Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV-VI, accurately detecting conditions and preventing PIH (dark spots) on darker skin tones where other AIs fail.

Medical Safety Net: A "Handshake Protocol" allows the Cosmetic Agent to instantly trigger the Medical Agent if it detects a health anomaly during a routine beauty scan.

Privacy First: All analysis happens client-side. Your face data never leaves your device.

💡 Why It Matters

We are solving the "Triage Gap" in dermatology. By distinguishing between cosmetic concerns and medical emergencies, DermAid prevents unnecessary doctor visits for minor issues while ensuring serious conditions are caught early—saving money, time, and potentially lives.

Built for the Mumbai Hacks Healthtech Track.
